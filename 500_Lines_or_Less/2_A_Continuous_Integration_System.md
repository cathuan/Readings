# What is a Continuous Integration System?

The continuous integration (CI) systems are dedicated systems used to test new codes.
- Upon a commit to the repository, the system will test all the codes won't break any test.
- The system will fetch the changes, run the tests and report its results.
- The system is failure resistant.
- The system should be able to run the test in parallel so developers can achieve the results of the tests in a reasonable amount of time.
