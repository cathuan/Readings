# `argparse` module

This is a module I have been using for a lot of times. But I never really understand it and look deep into it.

## Get help

We can always run

    python program.py --help

to get helper information printed out. In a lot of cases, this may be useful when we want to run a program with arguments but don't want go to check the source code. In reality, I think we always check source code, which is very inefficiency...
